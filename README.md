## Hey, what are you doing here? 👁️👁️

Hello, my name is [Redacted], but I usually go by my online alias *Brochacho*. I am an ammateur coder who wishes to go to college and learn Computer Engineer; as of now, all I know how to do are very rudimentary things in both Java and Python.
If you know me from somewhere, it's probably from the Minecraft server **2builders2tools** :) Feel free to add me on discord @ brochacho#8087 if you need to talk to me!
